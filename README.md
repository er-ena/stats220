# stats220

*This is my repo for STATS 220.* 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in **statistics under BSc**.
* I am taking STATS 220 because...
  1. It is the only stage 2 statistics paper I have left that interests me
  2. It is also a prerequisite for [STATS 369](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/369).
* I am interested in learning about more R code/functions I have never come across before! 

A bit of a tangent but this is my current/favourite [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RnVC6CVOI08h4PPvjFXAa?si=2c93b74da6d84f86) for studying!

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/zVEx9TYbwtsAAAAd/tenor.gif)
