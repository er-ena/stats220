# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in statistics under BSc.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is the only stage 2 statistics paper I have left that interests me, and is also a prerequisite for STATS 369.
- I am interested in learning about more R code/functions I have never come across before!
